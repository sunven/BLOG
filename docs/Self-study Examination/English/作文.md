When it comes to the reading modes,different people hold different views,Some people suggest that they like reading E-books,while others think that reading paper books is better.From my point of view,I prefer the first one.

There are mainly three reasons for my view,On the one hand,it is convenient for people to read E-books. For example,you can download E-books from internet at any time and save them to your computers or mobile phones.You may read the books whenever you want.On the other hand,comparing with paper books,E-books can save more money.As we all know,E-books are much cheaper than paper books and sometimes they are even free to read.Finally,reading E-books can protect our environment. Instead of making by paper which have to cut a lot of tree and consume much energy, E-books are much more environment friendly.

Talking all above factors into consideration, I think E-books are better than paper books in the information age
